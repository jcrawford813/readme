# What is this?
This document highlights key points about me, my work style, and things you might find helpful when collaborating with me. Some aspects may come across as positive, others less so—but my goal is to be open, honest, and reflective.

I've seen a few people share similar readme links in their LinkedIn posts, and I thought it was a fantastic idea.

# Who am I?
My name is Jim Crawford. Professionally, I've worked as a pharmacy technician, biochemical researcher, developer, architect, consultant, manager, and executive—not necessarily in that order, and not always on a strictly upward trajectory.

 -   I have three children, currently aged 14, 9, and 8.
 -   I have two dogs. One is a 100lb doofus. The other is a little beagle/cattle dog that thinks all dogs, except for the doofus, need to get off her planet.
 -   I raise chickens in my backyard.
 -   I grew up in Nashville, TN, before heading to college in Knoxville. Afterward, I moved to Charlottesville, VA, where I got married and began (and later ended) a career in research. A few years later, we returned to Nashville.
 -   I can play several stringed instruments, though guitar and mandolin are my main ones.
 -   I take Tae Kwon Do classes with my youngest children. My youngest daughter has a higher belt than I do. I do this because I’m stiff as a board, and it helps.
 -   I’m a scout leader. I run our neighborhood Cub Scout Pack and volunteer with various troops in the Nashville area.

# What are my strengths?
-    Strategic Thinking - I look to find where we can be in *X* amount of time, and help make the plans and steps to get there.
- Laziness - Yes, this is a strength. I look to standardize and automate as much as I can. I'm still gritting my teeth at the hard-coded ages of my kids and wondering if I should do a nightly build that updates them on their birthdays so I don't have to touch this file unless I need to.
- Solutioning - I enjoy understanding problems, whether technical, organizational, or process, and working on the solution. I am happy to be the one that gives bad ideas to help trigger someone else's good ideas.
- Coaching - This is one that I have been told. I think I have a long way to go, but co-workers at some of my previous companies have told me that I was quite good at it. I will always do my best to enable those around me.
- Curiosity - I am generally more curious than not. Even when I'm silent, it is because I'm trying to digest what I am hearing and figuring out what else I'd like to learn. 

# What are my areas of improvement?
- Over-analysis - This is a big one for me. I can go too far down the rabbit hole. I am working to lean more towards good than perfect. Over-analysis also contributes to burn out in scenarios where I really shouldn't be doing so. It also slows down decisions that need to be quick and iterative.
- Conflict avoidance - While keeping peaceful can be good in some situations, there are many where it is healthy and promotes a high-performing team. I'm working on identifying and being more proactive in those latter situations.
- Coaching - While some have told me that this is a strength that I have, I view this as one of the best places for me to grow and improve as a person, and as a trusted advisor and leader.
- I need to get up from the computer screen and take more walks during the day.
- I can jump into a solution pretty quickly and forcefully, and it may make others afraid to offer their ideas, or feel that I am not considering their point of view. I'm learning to hang back in situations where I am leading.

# Working with me
- I work best in the mornings.
- Some days it is very hard to get a productive meeting with me after 3PM. This may change as my kids get older and can get themselves to their own activities. I will always let you know about conflicts and alternative times when you reach out.
- I block my Friday afternoons for planning and for learning cool concepts that caught my eye that week.
- If I say I am going to do something, then I will. If we do not agree beforehand on the priority of it, then I will do it when I am able. I will keep you up to date on progress and blockers when the work is started. If your needs change, I expect you to let me know.
- I prioritize my emails based on Mark Horstman's advice. My boss and teams/clients come first. If you cc me, I likely won't read it until later that week, and will treat it as FYI with no action needed. I also set three times during the day to check email (8AM, 11AM, 3PM), and do not have mail notifications turned on.
- I try to respond to communication as follows (when not traveling or on PTO):
  - Direct chat message and mentions: Generally within 30 minutes unless I am overrun in meetings.
  - Jira/ADO/Git comment: Within a day, unless it is informational.
  - Email: Within two days, unless I am cc'd.
- I block off time on my calendar for appointments, personal time, travel, meetings, dedicated work, etc. I strive to keep my calendar up to date so you can easily see my availability. If you need time, and I am blocked, reach out.
- If you send me a meeting request without an agenda, I will likely decline it as I assume it can only be unplanned and have no goal.
- I do not tend to check my mail, chat messages, or take calls, after work hours unless I had to be away for a large part of the work day, am on call, or an important event has been planned in advance. If you call me twice in a row, I will answer, as I assume it is an emergency.

# Working for me
- I treat my reports like adults. I will give you the tools and time you need to solve a problem, and I won't hover over your shoulder. I will do this until you show me otherwise.
- I will have weekly 1:1 meetings set with you. They will generally have the same agenda:
  - 45-50% What is on your mind
  - 45-50% What is on my mind for you, and feedback
  - 0-10% What is next for your growth / what feedback you have for me
- If I reach out to ask for help with something (while you are working, of course) and receive no response at all that day, I will assume that I am being ignored.
- If you say you are going to do something within a time period, I will assume that you will do it and give me updates.
- If you need to be out, I need to know so I can rebalance priorities and set expectations appropriately.
- I try to give feedback as quickly as possible, and during our 1:1s. You will never learn something new in our performance reviews.
- I expect you to keep your calendar up to date so I can easily set meetings that will not disturb your concentration, or be during a personal activity.
- If you decide to work after hours or on the weekend when things are not burning down, it should be for you first and the company second.
- If something goes wrong, then it's on me and we learn from it. When it goes right, you did an awesome job.
